YOLO Object Detection Demo - We're going to use a newer popular algorithm called YOLO to perform real-time object detection on video! Some Object Detection History (2001-2017) The first efficient Face Detector (Viola-Jones Algorithm, 2001) An efficient algorithm for face detection was invented by Paul Viola &amp; Michael Jones Their demo showed faces being detected in real time on a webcam feed. Was the most stunning demonstration of computer vision and its potential at the time. Soon, it was implemented in OpenCV &amp; face detection became synonymous with Viola and Jones algorithm.
